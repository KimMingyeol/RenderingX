        Disable60FPSLock: Trick the OS into rendering at >60fps without any screen tearing.
        This works on most pixel devices Running Android 9 and above, but you should manually check your OGL fps in the VR OSD.\n
        Unlimited: Render as fast as possible without VSYNC enabled. Decreases latency a lot but you might see artifacts.\n
        SuperSync: Lowest latency without artifacts.Only works on select phones.\n

    <string name="MSAA_LEVELS_DESCRIPTION">
        MSAA increases quality with very little performance loss.
        Which MSAA level to choose depends on your GPU power, screen resolution and magnification of your VR headset.
        Most modern tile-based GPUs can handle up to 4xMSAA with only 10-20perc. performance loss, while increasing quality significantly.
